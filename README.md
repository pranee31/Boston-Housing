# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Description
This project involves predicting housing prices in the Boston area using the Boston Housing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains various attributes such as crime rate, average number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more, which can be used to predict the median house price in thousands of dollars.

  - CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
  - ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
  - INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
  - CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
  - NOX: Nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
  - RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
  - AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
  - DIS: Weighted distances to employment centers
  - RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
  - TAX: Full-value property tax rate
  - PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
  - B: Proportion of blacks by town
  - LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population
  - MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
